    "### 1.4 Key Insights <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_1.4\"></a>\n",
    "This project extract job description data of three popular job titles -- Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Data Scientist, in recent couple of months from SEEK website. The job locations include eight major cities in Australia – Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Adelaide, ACT and Hobart. Among them, there are 2224 job advertisements for Data Analyst, 1180 job advertisements for Data Engineer, and 529 job advertisements for Data Scientist. From the analyzed results, the main conclusions can be summarized as follows: \n",
    "#### Top hottest required skills for Data Analyst: `SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python, Data Visualization, Reporting and Communication Skills`\n",

    "### 2.1 Data Cleaning - How to Use Regular Expression to Clean the Job Salary and Job Ad Posted Time? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.1\"></a>\n",
    "In this project, we did not analyze the job salary because the data was not plenty enough for the moment. This project focuses more on the analysis of required skills. Moreover, if we have enough recruitment data for several years, we can also analyze the trend of the data job market, for example, how the hottest required skills change over time.\n",
    "#### 2.1.1\tJob Salary Data Cleaning\n",
    "Firstly, we use Regular Expression to extract the salary data and transform them into float numbers from the database.\n",
    "Then, based on different salary range, the job salary can be divided into following three categories: \n",
    "- If salary is lower than 200, it is paid by per hour;\n",
    "- If salary is greater than 200 and lower than 2000, it is paid by per day;\n",
    "- If salary is greater than 2000, it is paid by per annual.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such way, the annual salary can be calculated according to the full-time working hours from Australian government website. There are 251 working days or 2008 working hours per year for a full-time working position.\n",
    "Finally, the data can be converted into a CSV file and needs to be manually checked for errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2\tJob Ad Posted Time Data Cleaning\n",
    "The job Ad posted time usually have the following suffixes:\n",
    "- ‘m’ means the job ad was posted minutes ago; \n",
    "- ‘h’ means the job ad was posted hours before; \n",
    "- ‘d’ means the job ad was posted days ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these suffixes, we can use the Python datetime library to calculate the Universal Time Coordinated date of the job ad posted time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2\tDimensional Modeling Method – How to Model and Transform the Data into Job Details Fact table and Job Info Dimension Table? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the dimensional data modelling technique will be applied to construct the data warehouse which\n",
    "could store and retrieve data quickly for the further analysis (Saxena & Agarwal, 2014). By applying the DDM in this project, the data behavior and domain can be easily understood, and their performance can be optimized.\n",
    "#### 2.2.1\tIdentifying Business Objective\n",
    "Based on the data we have collected, the business objective is to identify the required skills in various job position for the people who would like establish their career in the field of data. Therefore, the key words regarding skills will be extracted and analyzed from the job details.\n",
    "#### 2.2.2\t Identifying Granularity\n",
    "Granularity is the lowest level of information for the tables in the data warehouse. The grain will be used for identifying the level of details for the business problem. Hence, the grain of fact table are job_id, section_id, and line_id which can be used to identify each job details. The grain of dimensional table is job_id which could be used to identify job information.\n",
    "#### 2.2.3\t Identifying Dimensions\n",
    "Dimensions are used for categorizing and describing facts and measures. The job information of each job can be classified as the dimensions in this project. The dimensional table is used for storing the descriptive data and providing the context to the fact creation. In this case, the Job Info Dimensional Table contains all the dimensions of each job such as the job title, job company, job area, etc. \n",
    "#### 2.2.4\t Identifying Facts\n",
    "Since the aim of this project is to investigate the job skills that are required for each position. The fact refers to each job details that is posted as well as the fact table is utilized for storing a collection of measures such as section id, line id, job details, etc.\n",
    "#### 2.2.5\t Building the schema\n",
    "The star schema will be developed based on the following DDM analysis and the Entity Relational Diagram.\n",

    "### 2.3\tData Extracting - How to Filter the Related Recruitment Data for Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist from More Than 10,000 Job Descriptions? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.3\"></a>\n",
    "The search algorithm from SEEK website brings up lots of irrelevant job titles, such as business intelligence, accountant, etc. Therefore, before further analysis, we need to filter out the related recruitment data for Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist. In this project, we can use SQL LIKE and UNLIKE operator to identify whether if the job title belongs to these three titles or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, from `13,000` job advertisements, there are `2224` job advertisements for **Data Analyst**, `1180` job advertisements for **Data Engineer**, and `529` job advertisements for **Data Scientist**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4\tTerm Frequency Analysis – How to Use Word Count to Filter the Key Skills? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.4\"></a>\n",
    "From the downloaded job details data, we can calculate the appeared frequency of each meaningful word(s), including technical and soft skills. Then through the word cloud we can see which technologies are more important than others. We can also use SQL LIKE operator to identify which statements contain these keywords and count the distinct job ad number. According to the above word count and term frequency analysis, we can filter out `46 highly-demand technical and 12 soft skills` in the job market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 46 highly-demand skills are as follows**:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python, Cloud, Azure, AWS, GCP, API, Pipeline, Dimension Modelling, ETL/ELT, DevOps, CI/CD, Spark, Java, , Scala, Oracle, Kubernetes, Docker, Apache, Kafka, Linux, Snowflake, Data Warehouse, Data Modelling, Data Visualization, Data Migration, Data Management, Data Integration, Data Platform, Data Architecture, Data Factory, Databricks, Data Science, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Research, Statistic, Mathematics, Quantitative, Algorithm, Deep Learning, Statistical Analysis;\n",
